    "text": "&gt; I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here<p>When an incident occurs in prod and it affects the livelihood of 12.000 people (or more if you include family), you&#x27;d expect at the very least a post-mortem. I&#x27;ve never seen a company produce one after that.<p><i>What was the root cause?</i> crazy hiring, massive wage war<p><i>Could the current situation be anticipated?</i> hell yeah, out of a pandemic, war raging in Europe, petrol production going down, supply chain problems all over the world, resulting in inflation going massively up... Don&#x27;t need an MBA to anticipate the economy was par for a correction.<p><i>what could you have done to prevent this?</i> realize it was too good to be true. Don&#x27;t enter the rat race, be cautious about hiring. Focus business.<p><i>what steps will you take in the future to prevent this from happening again?</i> &quot;I take responsibility&quot; is a beautiful thing to say but it&#x27;s completely empty if you don&#x27;t take the consequences as well, and don&#x27;t learn anything in the process. I bet you that if&#x2F;when we recover from this dip, the same hiring practices as before will re-submerge so that resiliency doesn&#x27;t move and we see the same move in another 5&#x2F;10y. So I guess the answer to this question is &quot;none, loyalty goes only one way and trust me when I tell you that no-one is safe&quot;",
